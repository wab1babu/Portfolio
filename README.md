# This is Shulin Long’s Portfolio! 
## C++: 
 Projects I did when I had introductory C++ course at UCLA:  
 Project 1 includes the understanding of compile, logical and runtime errors.  
 Project 2 is a program that automatically prints the car rental charge.  
 Project 3 is to create an array for a drawing grid.  
 Project 4 is to practice the use of arrays, including appending, looking up an item, rotating a string left, checking for duplicates, reversing order, finding subsequences, looking if an item is in two arrays, and ordering an array.  
 Project 5 is about implementing a decryptor.  
 Project 6 consists of several small tasks regarding pointers.  
 Project 7 is about implementing a console game called “Gone with the Wind”  
## Python:
 Implementing a Catalan Cards Game  
 Application of Stochastic Process  
## MATLAB: 
 All related to optimization problems:  
 Data fitting problems using gradient descent method, Gauss-Newton method, LBFGS, and log barrier method  
 Sphere packing problem using penalty method  
## R (and little SQL): 
 Includes all notes and practice problems when I had Principles of Data Science course at UCSB
